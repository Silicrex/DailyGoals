# Hi how's it going idk what I'm doing yet

My first multi-file project idea. I took a detour to work on my Stock Manager project before completing it. With what I've learned from that experience, I'm going to be working on restructuring and finishing this!

Uhhh kind of in a weird state because I'm transferring this to a repo in the middle of a major restructuring. It is not currently in a functional state (it was at some point, but for the sake of new feature ideas and implementing better/more clear code, I've been tearing it apart quite a lot.)
