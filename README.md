# Hi how's it going idk what I'm doing yet

My first multi-file project idea! Took a detour in the middle to work on some other ones- and with the experience from that, I'm trying to overhaul/complete this one.

Uhhh kind of in a weird state because I'm transferring this to a repo in the middle of a major restructuring. It is not currently in a functional state (it was at some point, but for the sake of new feature ideas and implementing better/more clear code, I've been tearing it apart quite a lot.)
